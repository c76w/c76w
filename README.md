## Hello there ðŸ‘‹ welcome to my GitHub profile

### About Me

From a young age I have always been tinkering with things. Curiosity gets the better of me and I like to know how things work. As a child I would strip my toys down and then try to rebuild them - sometimes it worked, sometimes it didn't!

But thatâ€™s how we learn isnâ€™t it?

I have always been a quick learner, love a challenge and learning something new, always trying to push myself and keep my brain active.

Being a perfectionist, logical and technically minded with a creative streak is probably the reason that I have always tried to find the best way to achieve a task or goal to get the best results.

After testing the water with web development, I discovered that it would definitely keep me challenged and ticked all the other boxes. So, I suppose I got hooked.

Having worked in e-commerce over the last ten years, I have had to wear many hats and developed many skills along the way including HTML, CSS and JavaScript, jQuery, PHP, VBA, WordPress, SEO, Google Ads, Facebook and Instagram paid advertising and organic, Graphic Design using Adobe Creative Suite and Canva, short Videos creation, CAD drawing using Sketchup.

Everyday is a school day, as they say!

I have used a few frameworks along the way including Bootstrap, Laravel, Livewire, Vue.js and React.js
